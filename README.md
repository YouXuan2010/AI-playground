# My AI Projects

Welcome to the repository containing my various AI projects. Below is an overview of each project:

## Projects

### 1. LLM Analyst

The LLM Analyst represents an AI application developed with Streamlit, seamlessly integrating OpenAI's GPT-4 to form a flexible tool for querying information from CSV files. 

Boasting functionalities like file uploading, query input, and dynamic response generation, the application harnesses the power of langchain_experimental's agent_toolkits and the ChatOpenAI module. 

This ensures users a smooth interaction with the sophisticated langchain framework, providing a robust and technically sound approach to extracting information from structured datasets.

LLM Analyst is an AI tool that reads CSV files and processes them to generate responses to user queries.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a cutting-edge conversational AI system, leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 and advanced technologies like FAISS-GPU and OpenAIEmbeddings.

By combining generative and retrieval-based approaches, RAG provides contextually rich responses and ensures the AI stays up-to-date with the latest information. 

This versatile solution is ideal for companies seeking to manage and retrieve proprietary information dynamically, offering a powerful tool for maintaining a knowledge base that adapts to the evolving landscape of data.

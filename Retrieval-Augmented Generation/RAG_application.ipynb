As of a few days after the incident, four of the five victims had been released from the hospital, while one remained in stable condition. The Baltimore Police Department released video and photos of four individuals seen near the scene of the shooting, asking the public for help in identifying them.

However, despite Fitzgerald denying any knowledge of the hazing, the university decided to fire him shortly after his suspension. Fitzgerald is now suing Northwestern University and its president, Michael Schill, for at least $130 million, claiming wrongful termination among other charges. He asserts that he had an oral agreement with the university that he would not face further discipline after the suspension. The lawsuit also seeks damages for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.'"

These updated vaccines were set to become available in mid-September. Additionally, Katalin Karik√≥ and Drew Weissman received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work on mRNA vaccines, which have been a crucial tool in curtailing the spread of Covid-19. Their work laid the foundation for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to use a new approach to produce vaccines using messenger RNA or mRNA. This revolutionary technology can potentially be harnessed to develop vaccines against other diseases like malaria, RSV, and HIV and offers a new approach to infectious disease like cancer, with the prospect of personalized vaccines.'"
